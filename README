	- IP address of enr3 with netmask, gateway and so on
    - the second interface must not have any Ip address
    
must change in globals.yml:
	kolla_internal_vip_address  ### with the same parameters of /etc/network/interfaces
	network_interface           ### with the same parameters of /etc/network/interfaces
	neutron_external_interface  ### choose another net for the management (doesn't matter)

must change in kolla-stein-step03.sh: vdb --> DISK_NAME

    sudo pvcreate /dev/vdb
	sudo vgcreate cinder-volumes /dev/vdb

	EXT_NET_CIDR='10.0.3.0/24' # change with the externl network
	EXT_NET_RANGE='start=10.0.3.50,end=10.0.3.99' # set of external IP address avaiables for VMs

# system script is NOT, so you must check it that everything it's ok.
